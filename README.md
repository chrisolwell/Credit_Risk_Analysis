# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Analysis Overview
The writer undertook the analysis to determine the credit risk of loan applicants. We used six supervised machine learning models, including decision trees, ensemble learning, random forests and others, to analyize data on thousands of loans and predict whether an applicant was likely to repay. We have far more data on good loans than bad loans, so we used a variety of methods in an attempt to prevent against biases this imbalance could introduce.

## Analysis Results
### Oversampling (Naive Random)
Naive random oversampling resulted in an accuracy score of .63, and the report is below:.

## Analysis Summary
The score we care about most if we want to reduce the chances of lending money to someone who won't repay it is the F1 score in the high risk category. That's what shows how many loans we want most to avoid: the ones that were predicted to be repaid but weren't repaid. 

In this analysis none of the models had a great f1 score in the high risk category; the best was that generated by the EasyEnsemble AdaBoost Classifier. But at 14 percent it still mis-predicted a significant number (8) of bad loans. As a result, this writer would recommend that algorithm from among those performed for this analysis. However it would be prudent to improve the algorithm because 8 bad loans
